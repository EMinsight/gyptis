  abstract = {We calculate the two-dimensional local density of states (LDOS) for two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of a finite cluster of circular cylinders of infinite length. The LDOS determines the dynamics of radiation sources embedded in a photonic crystal. We show that the LDOS decreases exponentially inside the crystal for frequencies within a photonic band gap of the associated infinite array and demonstrate that there exist ``hot'' and ``cold'' spots inside the cluster even for wavelengths inside a gap, and also for wavelengths corresponding to pass bands. For long wavelengths the LDOS exhibits oscillatory behavior in which the local density of states can be more than 30 times higher than the vacuum level.},

  abstract = {Light scattering by a grating of the metal (Ag)-coated nanocylinders supported on the dielectric substrate is investigated using an accurate and rigorous formulation based on the recursive algorithm combined with the lattice sums technique. The proposed approach could be applied easily to the various configurations of the grating composed of the metal or metal-coated nanocylinders with different types and locations of the excitation sources. Special attention is paid to the three types of resonances: (a) surface plasmon resonances associated with the metal nanocylinders, (b) Rayleigh anomalies related with the periodic nature of the grating, and (c) resonances due to the coupling between the grating and the dielectric substrate. Near-field distribution of the magnetic field, which is parallel to the axis of the nanocylinders, is investigated numerically. Physical insight is given to the localization of the field along the interfaces of the metal nanocylinders, formation of the strong reflected field by the grating, and the field enhancement at the surface of the dielectric substrate. The accuracy of the numerical analyses has been tested based on the principle of the energy conservation. All these features are technologically important and have wide practical application from the viewpoint of the flexible design and fabrication of the plasmonic optical devices.},

The PEMC is characterized by a single parameter M, where M = 0 reduces to the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) case and the limit M \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$} corresponds to the perfect electric conductor (PEC) case. The theory allows for the occurrence of cross-polarized fields in the scattered wave, a feature which does not exist in standard scattering theory. The application of the theory to the calculation of the scattering cross section and of the bistatic scattering pattern is presented.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel formulation of the finite element method adapted to the calculation of the vector field diffracted by an arbitrarily shaped crossed-grating embedded in a multilayered stack and illuminated by an arbitrarily polarized plane wave under oblique incidence. A complete energy balance (transmitted and reflected diffraction efficiencies and losses) is deduced from field maps. The accuracy of the proposed formulation has been tested using classical cases computed with independent methods. Moreover, to illustrate the independence of our method with respect to the shape of the diffractive object, we present the global energy balance resulting from the diffraction of a plane wave by a lossy thin torus crossed-grating. Finally, computation time and convergence as a function of the mesh refinement are discussed. As far as integrated energy values are concerned, the presented method shows a remarkable convergence even for coarse meshes.},
