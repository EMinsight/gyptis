  abstract = {An analytic theory for the electromagnetic scattering from a perfect electromagnetic conductor (PEMC) cylinder is developed. The PEMC is characterized by a single parameter M, where M = 0 reduces to the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) case and the limit M \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$} corresponds to the perfect electric conductor (PEC) case. The theory allows for the occurrence of cross-polarized fields in the scattered wave, a feature which does not exist in standard scattering theory. The application of the theory to the calculation of the scattering cross section and of the bistatic scattering pattern is presented.},
