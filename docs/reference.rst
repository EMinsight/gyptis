Welcome! This is the documentation for Gyptis |release|, last updated on |today|.

Gyptis is an open-source Python package to solve problems 
in Photonics and Electromagnetism using the Finite Element method. 
It relies on Gmsh_ for geometry definition and meshing 
and FEniCS_ for solving Maxwell's equations.

For a more practical introduction, check the 
:ref:`tutorials with worked examples <sphx_glr_auto_examples>`.
